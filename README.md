### Tutorial

When you first log in you will be redirected to the main menu (See screenshot #1), here you can create a personal calendar or create a team. <br> You can use team's to create shared assets like Company Beamer's (See screenshot #2). <br> When you have created a calendar you will be able to add Assets and personal calendars. When you have created an asset, it will be displayed at the main menu (See screentshot #1). <br> When you click on the asset you have created, you will be redirected to the reservation page of the asset (See screenshot #3). <br> Here you are able to create reservations for that asset, by dragging from and to the desired times. <br> An modalbox will popup and you will be able to give more information about the reservation, specify the given time and make the reservation recurring.
